# RebootFront
This is the frontend part of the Reboot Manager project, built using **Angular** and **TailwindCSS**. It connects to the backend Spring Boot API and displays data related to rebooted and postponed machines, with role-based views for technicians and managers.

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.8.

Make sure the following are installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16+ recommended)
- [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli)
- Git
